# Topic-based Podcast Website

This is a generic, sanitized version of the Django code for
[grubstakers.net](https://www.grubstakers.net/), the website for the podcast Grubstakers.
The purpose is to create a basic topic-based podcast website which allows for podcast episodes
to be easily connected to medium-length pages detailing the topics covered in by those episodes.
The purpose is to give potential listeners a sense of the topic being covered without an hour-long
commitment, but with more detail than a short SoundCloud description would cover.
Both the episode pages and topic pages also allow for citations.

The back-end is designed so that podcast hosts and producers with little to no technical backgrounds
can easily update the website as needed. There is also a search functionality for episodes
and topics.

Familiarity with Django is required to run this code as a number of configuration steps are needed
for it to function properly. This project is currently configured to run in Docker.
